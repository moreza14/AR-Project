# Augmented Reality Poster Presentation 

This project aims to enhance my poster with the title of "Design optimization of two qubit gate functionality in a trapped ion setup".
In this poster I explore the entangling gates developed in the trapped ion system. and present some high fidelity low power gates that could prove useful in development of a qunatum computer.

You can enter the deployed webstie from this repo and hover your phone camera over my physical poster to see more details and explore more information about my poster in the augmented reality.

## Physical Poster

The physical poster was presented at SFU's poster session on March 31 and Quantum BC's reseach day on April 28.
